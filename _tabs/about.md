As a passionate Computer Science graduate from Boston University, I thrive on the creative and dynamic world of technology. With 4 years of hands-on experience in full-stack development, I've crafted engaging and innovative websites that leave a lasting impression. <br /><br />

Beyond coding, I'm also a social media celebrity where I share my journey and connect with a vibrant community. But beyond the screen, I'm someone who seizes every moment to enjoy life to the fullest. I believe in experiencing everything I've never experienced, making new friends, and embracing a life that's anything but mediocre.
